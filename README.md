# Maze Lab Rewrite

NOTE: The main branch is primarily for ensuring that the code runs properly, the code that is ready 
to be used in the official lab is in the modified-initial-code branch.

Changes:
* Added static variables to MazeApp for defining colors
* Swapped out the mazeDisplay text area for a image display area
* Added text antialiasing (mostly for linux)
* Added addImage(), scanMaze(), stringToColor(), and refreshImage() methods in MazeApp
* Modified README.MD to include updated information
* Added "Maze display code rewritten by August Junttila" into the documentation comment in MazeApp
